Hi this is the node app with logger of winston and pino 

i used both here to demonstrate which is more featuristic and performance 

for performance and simple configuration use pino

for featuristic use can use winston, it has all the thing related to logger 
i have implement and configure both the logger for simpler demonstration for my future project and you can gain knowledge with how to config 
and log rotate ( removed after certain period ) only using winston and i have search for and wide there is manual rotate with log rotate pack 
and if some using pino with log rotate for the implementation is always welcome 

and i have tried out some of the advance topic in node js which is worker thread ( for simply require for image process )

Thank you all...
